            <h1>About Kilometer Creative.</h1>
            <h3>In June, 2017, Matt Vredevoogd and Kaeden Wile founded Kilometer Creative LLC with the intention of turning their hobby into a business. They wanted to take their passion for 3D modeling and headphone design into the mainstream. Ideally, they would disrupt big players in the industry. In doing so, their revolutionary headphone technology could bring higher quality, higher fidelity, more affordable sound to market. As of this week, they have done so. With the release of the EARCanS 2000S. Available at Best Buy, Walmart, and Target for only $19.99.</h3>

            <h1>Our passion for headphone design.</h1>
            <h3>It began in march of 2017. Both Kaeden and Matt had just began studying for AP tests when they realized most headphone designs just weren't cutting it. Beats had great sound quality but were far too expensive for the average consumer, while cheap headphones such as Apple's earpods just failed to deliver. With this realization came the desire to create someting new and amazing, something that would define portable private audio delivery systems for millennia to come.</h3>
