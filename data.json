To play Tileform, you press one of 3 or so buttons on the screen and some of the tiles on the screen will change colors or move. All you have to do is press the right buttons in the proper order to make all of the tiles become the same color."

We went through multiple iterations on pretty much every part of the game: design and aesthetic changed multiple times, our procedural generation had to be completely rebuilt twice, and the store and power-up system were being tweaked the entire time. At the end of the day, what we kept coming back to was this idea of ‘simplicity.’ We wanted a game that was challenging and replayable without being complex and could be portrayed through visuals that were clean and modern."
