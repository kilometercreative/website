Whenever you spend or receive money, let Dime know and soon you'll be seeing a real-time image into your spending habits, the balance in each of your accounts, and if you're spending more money than usual for the day. Dime is made to be simple. Setup is quick and easy, just name the accounts where you keep your money (sources) and maybe add a category or two. Entering expenses is a snap, and powerful insights are just a tap away. There's no login, no connecting external accounts, no mess. It just works."

To play Tileform, you press one of 3 or so buttons on the screen and some of the tiles on the screen will change colors or move. All you have to do is press the right buttons in the proper order to make all of the tiles become the same color."

At the end of the day, what we kept coming back to was this idea of ‘simplicity.’ We wanted a game that was challenging and replayable without being complex and could be portrayed through visuals that were clean and modern."
